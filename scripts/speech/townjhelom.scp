				sayu They sayu Skara Brae has all the conveniences of home. Unusual in an island, surely.
				sayu They got mind magic in Skara Brae. Not firebolts so much as scramblin' up thy head.
				sayu I hear the land on Skara Brae is good cropland. They even have rangers to keep the farms safe.
				sayu It's bad positioning, that's what it is. Skara Brae is unprotected from any evil that comes from the sea. 'Tis dangerous to sail there.
				sayu They be the best shipbuilders in Skara Brae. Except Minoc of course. Maybe Britain, too. Still, they build fine, fast ships!
				sayu The rangers in Skara Brae are second to none!
				sayu A ranger who trained in Skara Brae can survive nearly anything nature can devise. They are marvels with animals, too.
				sayu Skara Brae would be a far happier place if they could rid themselves of pirates!
				sayu Very clean folk in Skara Brae. I'm told they'd rather bathe than eat, if they had to choose.
				sayu I met a lady from Skara Brae once. She said that inside every body is all the 'etheric culmination of the intellect,' with compassion and rationality. Something like that. I lose sleep thinkin' on it.
				sayu Poets! Everyone in Skara Brae is a poet! That's no good at all!
				sayu You couldst not swing a fish in Skara Brae wiyout you slappest two rangers.
				sayu I met a man from Skara Brae who said that on his island, earrings on a lass was as rare as wigs on a chicken. I've yet to figure what he meant.
				sayu A mercenary from Jhelom can always find work in Skara Brae.
