				sayu Jhelom? 'Tis to be found at the very most northern tip of the largest Valarian Isles.
				sayu Me, now I've been to Jhelom in my youth, and what I remember most of all 'tis the hard, rocky beaches and the oddly sparse jungles.
				sayu Jhelom 'tis the very place to go if you'rt looking to hire mercenaries.
				sayu An overabundance of mercenaries are found in Jhelom ... and the shops and other establishments that serve them that fight for a living.
				sayu My sister lived in Jhelom for near on two years. She didn't like it ... too harsh for her tastes. All steel and iron, no silks and satins.
				sayu There's only hard-edged rational folks in Jhelom. They've no use for mages, but a magic weapon or potion will fetch a fine price most days.
				sayu They need a fair amount of goods in Jhelom. They once tried to set up a colony - called New Jhelom - to grow their goods for 'em. It didn't work out. Now it's called Nujel'm and 'tis a nasty wicked place.
				sayu There's not a lot of natural good to be grown or mined at Jhelom. Rocky, you knowest.
				sayu Jhelom? They breed and train the best horses in the realm. Famous for it.
				sayu 'T'ain't no horse better than a Valorian steed from Jhelom. Best war-mount a warrior could want.
				sayu Jhelom? Pah! 'Tis a militocracy. Only ex-generals can rule, or some such nonsense.
				sayu 'Tis very like Trinsic and Serpent's Hold. If you likes one, you wilt enjoy t'other.
				sayu Jhelom sounds dangerous to me. Everybody's armed and 'tis said they'll challenge thee to a duel for no good reason.
				sayu They're very daring in Jhelom. Good swordsmen and skilled riders.
				sayu You'lt do fine in Jhelom. 'Tis only cowards they despise.
				sayu Cannot sayu I care much for the ethics of Jhelom. Watch thy comrade's back, watch thine own. Paranoia, I call it.
				sayu I saw a dance from Jhelom once. 'Twas done in Britannia. Looked like hackin' and slashin' and kickin' to me. Take away the music and you wouldst call it a riot!
				sayu Jhelom? Now there is a town wiyout a lick of beauty. Sad, really.					ENDDO

				sayu Lord British is the ruler of Britannia.
				sayu Lord British? Why, he's our ruler, or course!
				sayu I've never seen Lord British myself.
				sayu I'm told Lord British has a castle with a moat. I'll wager there are gargoyles on his parapets, too.
				sayu Lord British could do with spending some time with the common folk, I think.
				sayu Lord British saved us all from the evil Lord Robert, or something like that. I forget exactly.
				sayu Now that I think on it, Lord British is probably a fair touch older than he looks. Do you think he might be ... magically sustained? No, never mind. Forget I said anything.
				sayu Lord British lives in Britain. Come to think of it, that kinda makes sense.
				sayu Didst you ever wonder why the king is called 'lord'? Passing odd, I call it.
				sayu Lord British sits in judgment in many courts. He needs must know a lot.
				sayu I'd follow Lord British anywhere.
				sayu Me mum told me that Lord British was saved from a mongbat by a silver serpent. I've never even seen a mongbat.
				sayu If I were Lord British, I'd build a house in Nujel'm. That's what I'd do.
				sayu Lord British knows everything.
				sayu Me dad was once resurrected from death by Lord British. He was eaten by an ettin. It was a good job for Lord British to even find enough pieces to work on.
				sayu Lord British is the best ruler we've ever had. All the school books sayu so.
				sayu If Lord British were a pile of gold, do you believe he would think he were a horse? It probably wouldn't matter one jot, so long as you got around faster.
