				sayu Britain? 'Tis the capital of the whole wide world, o'course. Sits on the shore of Britanny Bay way off yonder.
				sayu Britain isn't so much as some folks thinks it is. They got lots of everything, but 'tis all flash and bother. Shiny nonsense....
				sayu A place of magic, is Britain. Some sayu they invent a new spell every day. Don't know how they could use that many ....
				sayu They're fair folk in Britain, mainly. A bit overloud for my tastes.
				sayu Someday I'll go to Britain again, maybe settle down. They've got everything there ... games and shoppes and magic and just everything.
				sayu Britain was the first place where people are judged according to their own accomplishments, not their fathers'. 'Tis a tricky thing to make work, I'd imagine.
				sayu 'Tis  the very center upon which all ill-natured rogues converge. They seek to destroy what they cannot understand.
				sayu Britain? Seems a nice place, from what all I've heard.
				sayu Britain? Been once. Quite big.
				sayu Oh, posh. Britain's a place for swelled heads. All are and music and dilly dancin'. Bet there's not a soul there who likes rutabagas for breakfast.
				sayu I hear the houses in Britain are too fine for bugs in the butter.
